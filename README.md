# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Connect to an API (we will be using FourSquare and Yelp) and using POI retrived from the API, we will build a good linear regression model that can help us predict our dependent variable using good independent variables. We will also create a good visualization to make it easy to understand what is going on for everyone to see.

## Process
1. Get information of bikes from citybikes API
2. Get information from FourSquare and Yelp API
3. Clean data to remove improper data
4. Use visualization to view data better
5. Create a linear regression model and to check which independent variables fit the best for the dependent variable.

Open the notebooks folder and follow through the files in this particular order:
1. city_bikes.ipynb
2. yelp_foursquare_EDA.ipynb
3. joining_data.ipynb
4. model_building.ipynb

## Results
Mostly just using FourSquare API, since I have preferred it over Yelp, I have concluded there aren't any correlation between the number of bikes in a bike station and the variables found in restaurants.

## Challenges 
The challenges I have faced is finding the correlation between free bikes and variables in restaurants.
Working with API's isn't too difficult but it is definitely time consuming and needs to spend a lot of time to see how it functions.

## Future Goals
Try to interact with more variables/fields besides the ones I chose to see if they have any correlation with free bikes.
Explore other data visualization libraries such as plotly.
See if I could do more data cleaning to improve my results.
Work more with Yelp API since I focused more on FourSquare to see if I get different results.
